So, by utilizing it to do something for everyone’s interest in coding, our Tech-Secretary Tabish organized Code-topia Workshops on 21st March and 26th march. The motive of these workshops was to help particularly those, who were new to coding and its essentials. Overall, the event was great with some extraordinary cooperation in the (informal,xD) Tech Council."

The Fanta-Six was the FYSC’s version of the IPL Fantasy league and was organized keeping in mind the large cricket fan-base that you see everywhere, including our batch. There was a players’ auction before the beginning of IPL, and this event was amazing, with teams offering huge prices for batsmen, eventually left with less to nothing. Fanta-Six ran parallel with the complete IPL season(first half) and saw Team Dhurander dominating everywhere. After starting at the bottom, Team Simps managed to dominate the second position, leaving other teams to battle it out closely. Totally 8 groups of 4-5 students took part and a rule book for Fanta-Six was meticulously prepared by the organising team. Unfortunately, Fanta-Six had to be suspended in between, just like the IPL. People remain eager to witness its restart and hopefully we get to see the winners at the end of IPL"

When shelter-in-place orders came down, millions of individuals switched to online meets and so did we, with google meets and discord servers. It was pretty common for us at that time to play games and discuss stuff online. Our Cult-Sec, Smriti and her buddies organized a games night for  us freshers. Different games such as ludo, scribbl,uno, trivia test, among us, and meme mania were conducted. Incredible cooperation from the 2020 batch with full bliss and parcels of fun was amazing to witness, including one of our extraordinary professors, Dr. Sagnik Sen, who took interest for participating in the same (guided by samy to play among us, xD). We got our winners as Aaryya das for the trivia quiz and Sadock Chakma for meme mania."

A stressed-out brain does not learn. “These were the brief reactions of our batchmates regarding not opening the campus. A bold initiative by Tarun was to raise voices of the students against them, by mailing(spamming, xD) the Dean and the Directors and whosoever’s email-id we obtained. Some seniors were in favor of us, some were not, giving us some funny reactions. As expected, no reply came from the institute regarding the opening of campus for the 2020 batch."

Many first-year undergraduates took part enthusiastically which included Aditya Kalyani, Priyanshu Jayara, Borella Bharat Chandra, Aryan D Trimukhe, Lokesh B Jogi, Deepu Kumar, Aryaman J Singh.

After collecting all stats from students, with reasons why KVs are not convenient, an email was sent to the Academic Staff. The amazing reply we got was- “Nothing is impossible”, basically shutting our voices down. We all gave our exams offline, with many facing issues. From the Security Guard not allowing us inside, to the Principal arriving two hours late and what not. The only good thing was that at least a few of us met each other. All the endeavors by students to dodge this were undertaken with no success."

The Open Mic event gave the performer the stage to present their hobbies and express themselves in their unique way. The event kicked off with Samy’s presentation of his Graphic Designing pironess, which he is very well known for in our institute. Harrithha and Tabish mesmerized us with their melodious singing. Meghana showed off her dance moves and Hari rocked the stage with his Piano performance, with his piano rendition of AOT being the most memorable performance."

There were numerous introduction programs that sadly remained completely online at that time. Different sorts of sessions were organised, which include: Director’s address, Student Mentorship Program, YourDost, Workshop on music, Talk to the theatre, Samwaad, Ice breaker, Gender Sensitization workshop, and finally, but not the heaviest, Lunch with seniors."
